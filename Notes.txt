Reconciliation: The process of comparing the Virtual DOM tree with the actual DOM tree and updating the DOM efficiently.

Fiber: The internal implementation that makes reconciliation and rendering more efficient,
       flexible, and responsive. It allows React to handle updates incrementally, prioritize work, and improve performance.
       Fiber allows React to render on platforms other than the DOM (e.g., React Native).


Key Features of Fiber

Incremental Rendering:
Fiber enables React to pause and resume rendering tasks. This allows React to split rendering work into smaller chunks,
 prioritizing more urgent updates and deferring less critical ones.
This is especially useful for maintaining a responsive UI while handling heavy computations.

Priority-Based Updates:
Each update in React is assigned a priority. For example, user input like a button click might have higher priority than
 a network request.Fiber helps React process these updates based on priority, ensuring a smoother user experience.

Concurrency:
Fiber introduces concurrent rendering, where React can work on multiple tasks simultaneously, pausing low-priority tasks
 to focus on higher-priority tasks.This makes React capable of handling animations, user interactions, and data updates more seamlessly.

Improved Reconciliation:
Fiber enhances the reconciliation process by breaking the Virtual DOM tree into smaller units of work (called fibers).
It performs diffing more efficiently by processing these fibers incrementally.
